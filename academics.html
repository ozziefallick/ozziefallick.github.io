	<h3>Academics</h3>
	<p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland. I expect to graduate with a B.S. in computer science and a B.A. in linguistics in May 2014. I'm working on an honors thesis in machine transliteration under <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/" target="_blank">Hal Daumé III</a>.</p>
	<p>During the summer of 2012, I attended the <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/verwaltung-dezernate/iii-internationale-angelegenheiten/abteilung-3/deutsch-lernen/sommerkurse/unterricht-klassen/internationale-sommerakademie.html" target="_blank">Internationale Sommerakademie</a> at the <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/" target="_blank">Universität Tübingen</a>. There, I studied German at the B2 level, and took the Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (Economy and Society) module.</p>
	<p>As an underclassman, I was in the inaugural class of <a href="http://dcc.umd.edu" target="_blank">Digital Cultures and Creativity</a>, a program in the <a href="http://honors.umd.edu" target="_blank">Honors College</a> focusing on technology in society. I served on the program Student Council for both years.</p>
	<p>I am a member of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~upe/" target="_blank">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>, the computer science honor society, and <a href="http://www.studentorg.umd.edu/prim/" target="_blank">Primannum (ΑΛΔ and ΦΗΣ)</a>, the first-year honor society, and I was elected <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/pbk.html" target="_blank">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in April 2014. In Spring 2013, I was a TA for Data Structures, and in Spring 2014, I was a TA for Language and Mind.</p>
	<p>During my freshman and early sophomore years, I played for the <a href="http://www.studentorg.umd.edu/maqt/" target="_blank">Maryland Academic Quiz Team</a>.</p>

	<p>From 2006 to 2010, I attended the <a href="http://www.mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/" target="_blank">Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program</a> at <a href="http://www.mbhs.edu">Montgomery Blair High School</a>. Interesting courses I took there include Quantum Mechanics, 3-D Graphics, Software Design, Peace Studies, Middle East Studies, and International Human Rights.</p>
	<p>I was a member of the Blair <a href="http://itsac.mbhs.edu/" target="_blank">Academic Team</a> for 4 years, and captain for my senior year. During my time on the team, we won the DC championship of <a href="www.itsacademicquizshow.com/"‎target="_blank">It's Academic</a>, made it to the semifinals of Quizmaster Challenge, and won the Montgomery Academic Beltway League championship.</p>
	<p>After 4 years of French, I took 3 levels of Latin. I sat the <a href="http://www.nle.org">National Latin Exam</a> Level I <em>cum honore maximo egregio</em> and Level III/IV Prose <em>summa cum laude</em>, and was a member of the Latin Honor Society.</p>
	<p>I conducted a senior research project entitled Development of a Computational Model for Ancient Western Warfare with the assistance of Professor Daniel Robinson of Oxford University. The project won first place in computer science and second runner-up to the International Science and Engineering Fair delegation at <a href="http://www.sciencemontgomery.org/" target="_blank">ScienceMONTGOMERY</a>.
