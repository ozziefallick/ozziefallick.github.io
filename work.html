          I've been working with some roommates
          on <a href="https://github.com/tigrennatenn/Choron"
                target="_blank"> Choron</a>, which is a chore market
          for shared households. Choron allocates chores
          to residents who dislike each chore least, and creates a
          currency that residents earn by doing chores. This currency
          can be transferred between residents in exchange for favors.

	  From the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2013, I interned at
	  Arcode Corporation, originally through UMD's Corporate
	  Scholar Program. While at Arcode, I worked
	  on <a href="http://www.inky.com">Inky</a>, a smart email
	  client.

	  From the fall semester of 2011 to the spring of 2014, I worked on a
	  machine transliteration project for an honors thesis
	  under <a href="http://hal3.name">Hal Daum√© III</a>. In this
	  project, I
	  used <a href="http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/carmel/">carmel</a>,
	  a finite-state automaton evaluator, trained on Wiktionary
	  and Wikipedia data, to automatically transcribe words from
	  script A to script B, while replacing sounds from language A
	  that are unpronouncable in language B with their best
	  approximations in language B. As a result, if A and B use
	  the same script, then it returns language B's best
	  approximation of the word.

	  For my Digital Cultures and Creativity capstone project, I
	  made a Java program to convert written oratory to a MIDI
	  interpretation. I included a GUI to allow the user to create
	  their own mapping between International Phonetic Alphabet
	  transcription and musical notation.

	  During my freshman year, I worked on a program in Java to
	  visualize speech cadence in written language
	  under <a href="http://tanyaclement.org/"
	  target="_blank">Tanya Clement</a>.

	  During the Software Design course in my senior year of high
	  school, I was team leader on a 3-D space racing game
	  called <em>orbit</em>. In <em>orbit</em>, the player
	  controls a comet that loses mass when far from planets and
	  gains mass when nearby. The player must pass through a
	  series of waypoints to complete each race, using the gravity
	  of nearby planets to pick up speed. The game was written in
	  Java using OpenGL for the graphics.

	  As a Senior Research Project in high school, I researched
	  and constructed a model for ancient Western warfare,
	  corresponding approximately to the period between 500 BCE
	  and 500 CE. The user would set up a battle using the GUI I
	  made, and the battle would be simulated step-by-step to
	  determine a winner. The model achieved approximately 90%
	  success at predicting the winner (without any evaluation for
	  magnitude of victory) on the battles I tested it with.
