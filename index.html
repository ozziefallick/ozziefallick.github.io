	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>
	  I was born in Santa Monica, CA, and grew up in Bethesda, MD.
	  I currently live in College Park, MD, and I will be moving
	  to Palo Alto, CA, in August 2014, where I will be starting
	  as a software engineer at Google.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have <a href="academics.html">a B.S. and a B.A.</a>
	  in <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu"
	  target="_blank">computer science</a>
	  and <a href="http://www.ling.umd.edu"
	  target="_blank">linguistics</a> with a concentration
	  in <a href="http://www.german.umd.edu"
	  target="_blank">German</a> at
	  the <a href="http://www.umd.edu" target="_blank">University
	  of Maryland</a>.
	  My other academic interests
	  include <a href="http://www.classics.umd.edu"
	  target="_blank">Latin</a> and history.
	</p>
	<p>
	  From the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2013, I <a href="work.html">interned</a> at Arcode Corporation in Bethesda, MD, working on <a href="http://inky.com" target="_blank">Inky</a>, an email client.
	</p>
	<p>
          I hold <a href="fencing.html">a D2013 rating in sabre</a> from
	  the <a href="http://usfencing.org" target="_blank">United
	  States Fencing Association</a>, as well as a referee rating
	  of 8 in sabre and 9 in foil and épée. 
	  As an undergraduate, I fenced for
	  the <a href="http://umdfencing.com"
	  target="_blank">University of Maryland Fencing Club</a>,
	  where I was president for the 2012-2013 school year, 
	  sabre captain from 2012-2014, and two-time club conference individual
	  sabre champion. I still represent Terrapin Fencing, the USFA
	  affiliate of the UMD club.
